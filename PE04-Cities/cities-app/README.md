The Cities Application allows users to interact with city data through a simple user interface. Users can enter new city details, including the city name, country, and population via an input form. The application also loads pre-existing city data when launched. Clicking on a city name in the Cities List selects it for further viewing.


The program processes user interactions using React state management. When a user adds a city, the application updates the city list dynamically. Navigation between views (list, add city, and city details) is controlled using state (setView). The application maintains data consistency by updating the state array whenever a city is added.

The application displays the Cities List, detailed information for a selected city, and a form to add new cities. The interface updates in real-time, reflecting changes without page reloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.
