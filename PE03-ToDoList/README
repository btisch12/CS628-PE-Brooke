The ToDo List App can be analyzed using the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model, which describes how user interactions are handled to manage tasks effectively. The input involves users providing a task description through the text field and interacting with buttons to either add or delete tasks. Clicking the "Add Task" button triggers the addition of the entered task to the list, while clicking the "Delete" button removes a specific task. The process is managed using React's useState hook to maintain two states: todos (the list of tasks) and task (the current input value). When a task is added, it is validated to ensure it is not empty and then appended to the todos array. When a task is deleted, it is removed by filtering the array using the .filter() method. The output dynamically displays the updated list of tasks as individual ToDoItem components, providing real-time feedback to the user.
